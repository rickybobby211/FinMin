However, there are certain aspects of AI that major players such as Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI may not want the general public to be aware of. According to Raoul Pal, founder and CEO of Real Vision Group, the current AI boom is comparable to the biggest bubbles in history. Pal believes that the explosive growth of AI applications is going to create a huge bubble that will be impossible to ignore. He suggests that investing in semiconductor companies such as Nvidia is the best way for individuals to take advantage of this trend, as these companies provide the necessary processing power for AI systems. Microsoft and Google are currently the easiest ways for investors to gain exposure to AI. These companies have massive networks that will undoubtedly benefit from the growth of AI applications. Furthermore, both companies are pivoting their business models to incorporate AI, which will likely result in further growth and profitability. Pal also highlights the fact that AI is still in its early stages, and there are likely to be many more opportunities for investors to profit from this technology in the future. He notes that other major players such as Apple and Amazon are also developing their own AI technologies, and the Chinese have their own AI systems. However, Pal points out that the most significant game-changer in the AI industry is Stability AI. This open-source AI platform is available to everyone and is not restricted by any corporate interests or regulations. Pal suggests that this technology could be difficult to control and could lead to unforeseen consequences as it develops. Finally, Pal warns of the potential dangers of AI-generated fake content. With the development of chat, text-to-audio, and text-to-video AI technologies, the creation of fake content at an unprecedented scale is now possible. This poses a significant risk to society, and regulators will need to address this issue as AI technology continues to advance. In conclusion, while the growth of AI applications presents many opportunities for investors and businesses alike, there are also risks and challenges that need to be addressed. It is important for investors to stay informed and cautious as they navigate the rapidly changing AI landscape.""}, {""date"": ""20230303120002"", ""headline"": ""IBM Stock Is a Low-Stress Way to Invest in AI"", ""summary"": ""You might not think of IBM (NYSE:IBM) as a leader in the artificial intelligence space.

In 2023 alone, the company generated over $211 billion in revenue, and currently boasts a market cap of more than $3 trillion, making it the wealthiest publicly traded company in the world. What led to that success? Beyond the Ticker takes a closer look at the company's biggest moments. 1975 Bill Gates and Paul Allen founded Microsoft in 1975 to develop software for the Altair 8800, an early personal computer. 1980 Microsoft signed a contract with IBM (IBM) to bundle Microsoft's operating system, an early version of its MS-DOS, with IBM computers. 1985 Microsoft announced the first version of Windows, an operating system composed of a graphical user interface running on top of MS-DOS. 1986 On March 13, 1986, Microsoft kicked off its IPO, raising $61 million at $21 per share. 1995 On August 24, 1995, Microsoft launched Windows 95. The software would go on to be wildly popular among PC consumers and enterprise customers. 2000 Steve Ballmer took the reins at Microsoft, succeeding Bill Gates as the company\u2019s second CEO. 2001 The company jumped headlong into the console gaming wars with the debut of the first Xbox. 2008 Microsoft dove into the cloud computing space with its Azure service. 2014 Ballmer retired as Microsoft CEO, turning over the position to Satya Nadella. 2019 Microsoft\u2019s market cap crossed the $1 trillion mark for the first time. 2023 Microsoft kicked off its push into generative AI with a $10 billion investment in ChatGPT developer OpenAI, and the debut of several generative AI products including its revamped Bing search engine and Copilot software. The company is now riding the AI hype train as far as it can, adding generative AI software to everything from Office to Windows and everything in between.

After the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut this week kicked off a highly-anticipated easing cycle, Catalysts hosts Seana Smith and Madison Mills spoke with a panel of experts about how the two investment strategies could play out in the months to come. Vontobel portfolio manager Markus Hansen and Greenwich Wealth's CIO Vahan Janjigian join Catalysts to lay out their investment thesis. Vahan favors value over growth \u2014 but says he's not a strict value investor. \""What I really favor is stocks that are undervalued,\"" he says, \""and in many cases, that can be growth stocks.\"" In terms of investments, Vahan notes he's leaning toward traditional value stocks, like IBM (IBM), Verizon (VZ), and Pfizer (PFE). And in the wake of the Fed's latest rate cut, Vahan sees small caps (IWM) as benefitting from changes to the yield curve. \""I think as things normalize, we'll get back to what's considered normal. And that means value stocks outperform growth stocks and small cap stocks outperform large cap stocks.\"" Markus and his team at Vontobel are quality growth focused. He says post-rate cut, he expects dividends will get a lot of love from investors. That's why he's favoring \""good old fashioned names\"" like Coca-Cola (KO), Walmart (WMT), Home Depot (HD), and PepsiCo (PEP) for their sustained dividend growth. Luxury is also a sector he finds compelling for its wide economic moat. \""It requires time to build that heritage, and to be the top brand,\"" he says, and that longevity makes companies like Hermes (RMS.PA), Ferrari (RACE), and Richemont (CFR.SW) compelling.

Hugging Face now has more than one million public models available on its platform, with one new repository being created every 10 seconds.

In addition to the one million public models offered by the platform, Hugging Face has nearly as many private models that are being used by companies internally. \""So we're seeing this transition from AI for prototypes, for experiments, to AI in production. And in terms of revenue, I think that means more companies using our enterprise hub offering that has been very, very successful... in general, kind of like looking at more of the costs for AI, especially when you scale to make sure you can keep margins that are sustainable,\"" he tells Yahoo Finance. As more people and companies adopt generative AI, Delangue believes that right now, \""We're quite mainstream on the usage side.\"" He explains that there's been a \""catch-up\"" from investors and the public on the technology, adding, \""We're at the phase where it's slowed down a little bit, or at least we have a more realistic view of what AI can do and can't do.

Tesla (TSLA) stock is on the rise after the electric vehicle (EV) maker kicked off \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d earnings. With Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Apple (AAPL) earnings on deck, Synovus Trust senior portfolio manager Daniel Morgan joins Seana Smith and Madison Mills to discuss whether IBM or Tesla earnings are a better indicator of what investors should expect of Big Tech earnings. Morgan explains that IBM\u2019s earnings were mixed but ultimately supported the AI story, \u201cThe IBM number wasn't bad. They obviously missed on revenues. But I think the expectations coming into that third quarter report were extremely elevated \u2026 It's really kind of a mixed report because they did say they generated about $3 billion in revenues directly from generative AI, and of course, everyone's really focused on that.\u201d While IBM\u2019s mixed results send the stock lower, Tesla, which also reported mixed results, soars. Morgan says he thinks of Tesla as being \u201ckind of clumped into\u201d the Magnificent Seven group. \u201cPersonally, I don't see how Tesla fits into that group. To me, they're an automaker, but they seem to be rolled into the tech group.\u201d He notes that the positive reaction to Tesla\u2019s earnings adds to the \u201cgood momentum\u201d that comes into Big Tech's earnings. Big Tech earnings offer insights into how companies are spending on tech and their macro-level outlook. Morgan says that macroeconomic conditions continue to affect Big Tech spending as companies cut tech spending during heightened recession fears. He adds that the IBM report did have \u201csome indication\u201d of a slowdown of tech spending, with the IBM CEO saying, \u201cOne of the reasons why they fell up short in their consulting segment was the fact that CIOs are using money that would have been designated for consulting, and they're moving that into AI. They're not populating both. So we are seeing little bits of evidence that we may see some slowdown.\u201d To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalysts here.

In Krishna's view, the future is incredibly bright, especially under a new administration that may cut red tape. \""I think the AI spending from our clients is going to go up, I think the automation spending is going to go up, the labor demographics are going to get even worse, there's some policy statements that have implied that. Well, technology is a way to replace labor, so that means more technology will get deployed by our clients, and so those are the kinds of vectors that we are looking at to help accelerate our business.\"" Krishna also took issue with criticism that IBM's AI spending was not yet profitable, pointing to its generative AI book of business, which now stands at more than $3 billion, saying: \""I think in the past you might've been able to ding us that we were not able to monetize or convert our research into actual dollars. I think the last three years have been quite different.\"" As for offering up more compelling use cases for AI, Krishna said that just because they haven't all presented themselves yet, doesn't mean they won't be showing up later. \""This is one of those where if five years from now you're not using it (AI) in every part of your business, you're going to be fundamentally disadvantaged.\""To watch live and see every interview from Yahoo Finance Invest, click here.

D.A. Davidson Managing Director Gil Luria joins Morning Brief Hosts Seana Smith and Brad Smith to discuss where IBM stands in the AI era and how businesses are leveraging the emerging tech. IBM has \""one of the most valuable businesses in AI right now, which is a consulting business that helps companies figure out what they're going to do with AI,\"" Luria says, adding, \""Unfortunately for them, it's a relatively small part of the business. The overall business depends on a lot of other services and hardware and business process outsourcing. So, it may not drive very rapid growth for the overall company, but that consulting business is doing phenomenally well right now because so many companies want to know what to do with AI.\"" The analyst explains that \""almost all of AI spend right now is experimental. There's very few real-life products that are adding value and scaling, and that's not too surprising ... This technology is extraordinarily young. The big breakthroughs only happened a couple of years ago. Many of the breakthroughs just happened months ago. And so it takes a lot of time to refine this type of technology and to move it from being a breakthrough in science to being a productive enterprise software product that we can all use and create efficiencies and drive new revenue.\"" Luria notes that AI for enterprise use requires different standards than consumer AI. \""This AI technology still has to be refined. Let's not forget that just because we're okay with ChatGPT giving us a wrong answer one out of every five times, that's not the case for enterprise software. The technology has to be at a point where hallucinations are near zero for us to actually implement them in a real environment and use them for mission-critical systems.
