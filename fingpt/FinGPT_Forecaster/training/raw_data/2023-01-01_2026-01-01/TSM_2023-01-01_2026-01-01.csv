Early affirms: \""I don't think the Chinese economy is a big driver for semis [semiconductors].

China is almost uninvestable. That's hard to hear from an investing point of view because we try to keep politics out of it, but there's so many fundamental reasons to try to avoid China as much as we can...

The company also posted adjusted earnings per share of $5.16 versus an expected $4.64 per share. Antoine Chkaiban, New Street Research Technology Infrastructure Analyst, and Dan Morgan, Synovus Trust Senior Portfolio Manager, joins Yahoo Finance to discuss the results. Chkaiban elaborates on the possibilities for Nvidia in the future, along with AI chip making as a whole: \""Global spending on data center AI chips tripled in 2023 from $15 billion to $45 billion and is now set to double again to $90 billion in 2024. And if we look out a few years, well late last year, Lisa Su CEO of AMD (AMD) pitched a target addressable market for data center AI chips of $400 billion in 2027. So now we just need to think about the future along two axis. Either it materializes in a healthy and sustainable way or we fall short of this prediction, with disappointments, over investments, and lower returns.\"" Speaking to Nvidia's dominance in the space, against their competition, Morgan says: \""I think we have to think of Nvidia as first to market in AI. They have been talking on their conference calls and their product calls for over five years about the fact that they are dominant in the space. And then it came to fruition about a year ago, on this quarter, when they had the big blowout quarter.\"" He continues by mentioning one the reasons why Nvidia is ahead of competition: \""The average AI chip that Nvidia sells, we don't know the exact price, some of them are like $20,000 or $30,000 apiece. So you kind of wonder if like an AMD who's kind of known as being a lower-priced chipmaker, especially in the CPU area against Intel (INTC), or let's say the data service space, would they come to try to introduce a cheaper chip that maybe people would be willing to go with.\"" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.

Pence identifies Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. as a buy, highlighting the company's position in the world of artificial intelligence (AI). He explains that Taiwan Semi produces \""really high-value\"" chips, making it an \""absolute chokepoint\"" in the industry. Pence goes so far as to dub the company the \""most important\"" player in this space, as he believes \""no one is able to accomplish their long-term mission\"" without relying on Taiwan Semi's capabilities.

The Biden administration sought to expand domestic chip productions via the CHIPS Act by awarding grants to chipmakers Intel (INTC), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), and Samsung (005930.KS) in recent months. SIA CEO and President John Neuffer joins Yahoo Finance's Akiko Fujita to review the expected growth for chip fabrication and foundry businesses through the CHIPS Act investments into the private sector. \""It took us decades to get to this point,\"" Neuffer discloses. \""The two big numbers that I find most interesting coming out of this report are what would our global manufacturing footprint be without the CHIPS Act and would've fallen to 8%. With the CHIPS Act, it's at 14%. That's nearly the double the positive result. So... it's gonna take us years to kind of climb back. But with the CHIPS Act and with all these private sector investments, we absolutely turned the corner and are heading now in, in the right direction.\"" Neuffer broadly estimates that without the invigoration of the CHIPS Act, the US would be producing next to zero of the world's chips in that 2032 timeframe: \""With the CHIPS Act... we'll be manufacturing 28% of those chips. So that, that's the kind of fundamental shift in terrain.\"" Turning his attention to China's own semiconductor infrastructure, Neuffer characterizes the nation's chip industry as \""very focused\"" in its output of legacy chips. But finds that China's lean into manufacturing will create an \""over capacity\"" of chips that could lead to several down cycles for American chip makers. Some global officials have stood by their view that China's manufacturing push, driving global competition in areas such as chips and electric vehicles (EV), isn't going to \""fix the challenge\"" in its economy brought on by deflating consumer sentiment.

As Nvidia (NVDA) is set to report its earnings this week, HSBC Global Private Banking and Wealth Management Americas CIO Jose Rasco joins the show to discuss how the chip company and the overall AI push may impact the market (^DJI,^GSPC, ^IXIC). He explains that new technology, like artificial intelligence, is diffusing across all sectors as companies seek to find efficiencies and expand revenue. Rasco adds that Nvidia and the AI boom will ultimately drive deflation in the market, ultimately resulting in lower prices for goods and services. However, there are some geopolitical pressures facing the chip sector. ASML (ASML) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) could disable their chip machines remotely if China were to invade Taiwan, according to a report from Bloomberg. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon sparked speculation about his potential resignation after pivoting from his usual stance during the company's annual investor day and saying that his remaining time at the company is no longer five years. Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith explains what this means for the company's future and who might be considered to succeed Dimon. Lowe's (LOW) topped Wall Street's first quarter earnings estimates, posting revenue of $21.36 billion and gains of $3.06 per share. While consumer spending remains low, CEO Marvin Ellison points to loyalty programs and online spending as areas offsetting pullback concerns. Meanwhile, Peloton (PTON) is having a more difficult time dealing with the consumer sales slump as the home fitness company announced it is starting the sale of a $1 billion loan offering. Wendy's (WEN) and (TGT) both announced new initiatives to draw consumers back to their stores, from a $3 breakfast value meal to price cuts on five thousand items.

While many Wall Street firms are boosting their forecasts on the S&P 500 (^GSPC), Piper Sandler is dropping its year-end price target for the S&P 500 altogether. Piper Sandler co-chief investment strategist Michael Kantrowitz breaks down the call, explaining, \""If you're bullish on the S&P 500 this year for an institutional investor that's not buying the index, well, how does that really help them? Because you look at the market this year, we're up 16 [or] 17%. Typically, that much of a rally would come along with massive risk on leadership.\"" President Biden faces mounting calls for him to drop out of the 2024 presidential race. AGF Investments chief US policy strategist Greg Valliere notes that Democrats are in disarray over the possibility of not just another Trump presidency but the potential to lose a congressional majority and governorships across the nation. \""That would be a bloodbath for the Democrats, and that's a plausible scenario if [Biden] is still on the ticket,\u201d he states. Because of these high stakes, Valliere believes that there is a solid chance that vice president Kamala Harris could take the reins as the Democratic nominee. The tech sector is getting bullish calls as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) shares hit an intraday high, surpassing a $1 trillion market cap. Wall Street firms are lifting their price targets on the chipmaker. Similarly, Wells Fargo lifted its price target on Meta (META) from $593 to $625 per share, citing its robust second quarter ad performance. While Big Tech continues to drive markets to new highs, former Chairman of the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Tom Wheeler joins the show to discuss how Big Tech should be regulated. \""When we look at AI, we've got to recognize that all of the things that have happened in the last 12 months that have our heads spinning are probably the least amount of change that we will see in our lifetimes. And so the question becomes, how do we deal with that? How do we transform from an industrial economy that was overseen by industrial-era style regulation to a digital economy to an AI economy that has oversight to protect the public interest? And the challenge thus far is that at least in the United States, our policymakers have failed to step up to that challenge,\"" Wheeler says.

The cyberattack on CDK Global, the software provider for car dealerships across the US and Canada, led to system outages for auto dealers across North America. Meanwhile, prices for new cars remain well above pre-pandemic levels. CoPilot founder and CEO Pat Ryan explains that the hack \""really threw the industry back to the Stone Age in a lot of ways because with the systems locked down, they [car dealerships] couldn't do business the way they are.\"" He also points to \""structural increases in car prices\"" leading to consumer pressures: \""We're still up over 30% from pre-COVID. So there's sticker shock for people who have bought a car since before COVID. And then when you add in that most cars are bought with financing, about 80% of cars. And so when your car is bought with financing, interest rates go up and prices go up.

The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) sunk by 512 points \u2014 or 2.77% \u2014 in Wednesday's trading session. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) also closed 1.39% lower, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) saw a 0.60% bump higher to a new record high.

Adjusted earnings per share of $4.14 topped estimates of $3.93.

The airliner disappointed with its third quarter outlook, projecting adjusted earnings of $2.75 to $3.25 per share, coming in below the anticipated $3.38. Third Bridge global sector lead for industrials, materials, and energy Peter McNally explains, \""most of the market has gotten this heads up now that the airline industry is softening. There's just too much capacity right now and we're at a peak demand season. And it's weighing on the revenues outlook.\"" He adds, \""it gets more interesting for United longer term,\"" as capital expenditures seem lower year-over-year and Boeing's (BA) deliveries slow. He notes that United's future plans depend on getting new planes from Boeing, and he's keeping a watchful eye on how those plans get pushed. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) is currently in talks to by cybersecurity firm Wiz for a deal valued around $23 billion, according to Bloomberg.

Moorhead observes that due to the chip sector's strong momentum over the past year, \""any hiccup, any rumor of something\"" can trigger a stock decline. He suggests this downturn presents an opportunity for investors to identify potential high-growth companies beyond industry giants like Nvidia (NVDA), Broadcom (AVGO), and Intel (INTC). Moorhead advises investors to \""look at a mid-term and even... long-term approach of where those stocks are going or could go,\"" highlighting companies such as Qualcomm (QCOM). Regarding industry trends, Moorhead notes that many companies are pivoting towards AI, often at the expense of other initiatives. \""They want their IT groups to pivot to generative AI. And a lot of this is about FOMO, it's the fear of missing out,\"" he explains. This shift in focus is creating a divide in the market: \""That's why you see companies that aren't engaged in the generative AI wave are seeing very mixed results.\"" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Morning Brief.

Moor Insights & Strategy Founder, CEO, and chief analyst Patrick Moorhead joins Asking For A Trade to give insight into the tech sector, the AI trade, and what it means for Big Tech moving forward into the earnings season. Moorhead reiterates his thought from a previous interview: \""I really laid out a thesis that says the infrastructure build-out is going to continue for at least another year and maybe 18 months, and that's driven primarily by the downstream FOMO, or the fear of missing out, from those enterprise SaaS providers. Meta, who clearly showed that they're investing hardcore because they have to. If you are not investing in your competitors, you could be set back potentially a decade here. Moorhead is also looking at the long-term valuations of AI-adjacent software companies and chip designers like ServiceNow (NOW), Salesforce (CRM), Qualcomm (QCOM), and Arm Holdings (ARM) He ends with his thoughts that Nvidia (NVDA) has \""at least another 12 months to run. We saw TSMC (TSM), where Nvidia does all of their manufacturing, they're basically sold out through 2025 and into 2026. We just heard from Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta that that they're putting the pedal to the metal on this.

Tusk Venture Partners Founder And CEO Bradley Tusk joins Market Domination Overtime to give insight into Nvidia's earnings, the AI sector, and the potential for OpenAI's next round of funding. In terms of why Nvidia shares have been sliding, despite a positive Q2 performance, Tusk says: \""Really it's sort of I think speaks to a slightly broader concern, which is at the back of investors minds. They're starting to wonder like, 'hey, are we over inflating this? Is it going too far?' Because they couldn't have really done any better than they did. It's unreasonable. Like 'it's your fault.' It's not their fault. It's a question of are they overvalued and that's collectively our fault, right? \"" With the Wall Street Journal reporting that Nvidia is in talks about investing in OpenAI, Tusk comments: \""What's the strategic value for you in having a role with OpenAI? What they all might say is, look, we want a seat at the table. 'We want to know what they're up to. We don't want all of a sudden, Microsoft taking this thing going off in a totally different direction, that we can't compete with.'\"" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination Overtime.

The Federal Reserve Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr outlined revised capital requirement regulations for banks in a speech on Tuesday morning. The policy, named Basel III Endgame, proposes easements on banks' capital holdings while scaling back other requirements. Yahoo Finance senior reporter Jennifer Schonberger explains the Fed's new policy proposal and comments on Barr's speech. Chairman of Whalen Global Advisors Chris Whalen argues that the focus of this regulatory effort should have been on market risks rather than capital. He points out that since the Supreme Court overturned the \""Chevron deference\"" doctrine, which previously gave regulatory agencies the benefit of the doubt when interpreting ambiguous laws, federal regulators are now more \""vulnerable to losing in court\"" if banks choose to challenge their decisions legally. After last week's tech-heavy sell-off, many investors took the opportunity to buy the dip. Slatestone Wealth chief market strategist Kenny Polcari points to Nvidia (NVDA) as a buying opportunity as shares are down about 25% since its June high. He does not expect the stock to rally back up to its high, but rather, he sees it as \""on sale\"" for long-term investors. \""Now, if you're worried about further downside for the broader market and you think it's going to get dragged with it, well then just sit back a little bit and wait. I think, you know, for most of the clients, that's the conversation I'm having, just about being patient, because patience, in this case, could be a virtue,\"" he explains. As Nvidia's (NVDA) stock tumbled in August after failing to meet investors' sky-high earnings expectations, many are now wondering if this is the end of the chip giant's reign over the S&P 500 (^GSPC). Yahoo Finance Markets Reporter Josh Schafer breaks down how the index's leadership may change moving forward and how investors can best navigate the market as the Federal Reserve begins its rate easing cycle. The Biden administration has invested nearly $34 billion in building out domestic semiconductor manufacturing sites in just two years since the CHIPS and Science Act was passed. Former White House CHIPS Coordinator and Duke University professor of business and public policy Aaron \""Ronnie\"" Chatterji commends the government's efforts over the past two years, stating \""the government's done a great job\"" in attracting investments from major players like Intel (INTC), Samsung (005930.KS), Micron (MU), SK Hynix (000660.KS), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM). After Apple (AAPL) held its \""It's Glowtime\"" event on Monday, unveiling the new iPhone 16 along with next generation AirPod and Apple Watch devices, Bank of America senior IT hardware analyst Wamsi Mohan explains that the company is \""broadening out the ecosystem,\"" highlighting the health and fitness features on the new Apple Watch and AirPods. \""The number of applications that you're seeing is starting to broaden out, which brings in new users into the ecosystem and that's not even including the phone,\"" he adds. Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi sits down with Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius at the Goldman Sachs Communicopia and Tech Conference to discuss the Federal Reserve's rate cut path. Hatzius believes that a 25-basis-point interest rate cut will be the likely outcome at the September meeting, explaining, \""I think that's more consistent with the data that we've seen since the weaker-than-expected jobs report a month ago.\"" However, he wouldn't rule out a 50-basis-point cut, arguing that there is a \""solid rationale\"" for the larger cut. He explains that the fed funds rate is \""really high,\"" the highest among the G10, despite the US making more progress on inflation than other countries in the group. \""So you could certainly make the case that they should be bringing down that rate quickly,\"" he explains.

I don't see a lever to pull, whether it's taking money from Apollo, separating the company into two businesses.\u201d Apollo Global Management (APO), which is Yahoo's parent company, has reportedly offered a multibillion-dollar investment in the legacy chipmaker. There have also been reports that the company is considering splitting into two to separate its foundry segment from the rest of its business. \u201cAll of these roads I see leading to basically a ten-year slog in trying to turn this company around to fix the cultural issues. And unfortunately, that's just I don't see any faster way for Intel,\u201d Jackson explains. \u201cThe biggest thing that they have going for them is that the United States and the Western world need this Intel and their foundry business to succeed. It has to succeed, whether it's independently or it's part of Qualcomm (QCOM) or somebody else. But there has to be a protection against the possibility that [Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM)] gets sort of taken out if China was to invade Taiwan.\u201d Qualcomm has reportedly approached Intel to discuss a takeover. The deal would be subject to regulatory approval concerning antitrust issues, though Jackson says this aspect isn\u2019t a significant hurdle for the companies. \u201cQualcomm taking out Intel would pass muster because it's all about America. An American having basically a stake in this game going forward, so I think regulators would approve it.\u201d The portfolio manager suggests that it's not regulators that stand in the way of the deal but the companies themselves. \u201cWould Qualcomm investors be jazzed about it? Would Intel investors be jazzed about it? I mean, it has to work for both sides. I don't think Qualcomm would be willing to pay up even though this Intel is trading basically close to book value. And from an Intel perspective, why just be subsumed into this larger company at this 30-year low price in the stock? That's not really attractive for anybody who has, unfortunately, stuck it out through these last few years. So it's hard to see how there could be a deal here to be had that works for both sides.\u201d This post was written by Naomi Buchanan.

He emphasizes that Micron is currently riding \""a cyclical upswing\"" in memory demand, which he expects to continue through 2025. However, he cautions that this dynamic will eventually decelerate, suggesting that the current rally \""is a correction from too much pessimism\"" from investors, even as the fundamentals remain robust. \""As much as we liked the print, [and] we like the next four quarters for Micron, we still see long-term cyclicality in the future,\"" Kerwin states.

Hanbury says, \u201cThe best players in the industry recognize these bottlenecks and spend a lot of time identifying where these bottlenecks are, developing proactive mitigation plans like additional inventory and monitoring their supply base.\u201d Hanbury reports, \u201cWe see several months of inventory along the value chain, which will limit the immediate impact\u2026 We don't know the exact impact of the damage or how long it will take to get the facilities up and going again, but we think there's at least a couple of months of inventory to limit the immediate impact.\u201d For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination Overtime.

The Magnificent Seven is currently comprised of Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA). T. Rowe Price portfolio manager Dominic Rizzo joins Market Domination to discuss how investors can best play the tech sector. Many investors were disappointed during the second quarter earnings season as they looked for significant returns on their AI plays. Rizzo expects this theme to also prevail over the upcoming tech earnings season. However, he argues, \""when I look at the return on investment for the hyperscalers and for the entire technology sector, I actually think we're starting to see it.\"" He points to Meta Platforms (META) as an example, explaining, \""At one point during the year, people thought that Meta would have Q4 growth rates in the mid-single digits. Now, that number is closer to 20%. And why is that? That's because they've been able to use AI to get a lot better targeting in their core advertising business.\"" He also believes that Apple (AAPL) will see the beginning of an upgrade cycle as it offers AI capabilities on its iPhone 16 series. In addition, he argues that Nvidia (NVDA) is in the best position as the company is \""selling the linchpin technology to all of these vendors.\"" While the Magnificent Seven has been under pressure, Rizzo tells Yahoo Finance, \""I think the divergence that we've seen amongst the Magnificent Seven, and between the Mag Seven and the S&P 493, is really quite natural.\"" Rizzo notes that the Magnificent Seven has historically grown earnings at a rate of 50 to 100% faster than the rest of the S&P 500. He expects that to continue over the medium term, especially as many of the Magnificent Seven players are well-positioned for AI. However, at this moment, he explains that they are trading only at a 50% premium to the rest of the market, making them cheaper based on a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio. He finds AI will continue to drive innovation and push further growth in mega-cap tech names. With this dynamic at play, Rizzo expects the AI chip market to grow to $400 billion by 2027.

The chipmaker confirmed it was an issue on its end rather than its long-time foundry partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM). Moor Insights & Strategy founder, CEO and chief analyst Patrick Moorhead sits down with Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton on Market Domination to break down what the news means for Nvidia and the chip space. \u201cThis one's an interesting one. If you recall, there wasn't an issue, then there was an issue, and then Nvidia came out and talked about it a little bit. I was on the show and really said, \u2018Hey, regardless of what happens, unless it's a six-month or a one-year delay, they'll probably just buy the lower-performing version from Nvidia.\u2019 And I think what this does, though, this closes the door on any potential issues that may have arisen. I mean, they already said that Blackwell sold out for the next year,\u201d Moorhead tells Yahoo Finance. He adds, \u201cThis is classic finger-pointing between Nvidia and TSM. It's age-old. What is interesting, though, is how that spilled over into the public dialogue. And I don't think this is a positive thing for TSMC.\u201d Moorhead said the negative sentiment around TSMC based on the Nvidia delay and the reported US investigation into dealings with Chinese company Huawei could benefit competitors like Intel (INTC) Foundry Services. TSMC says there is no such investigation. \u201cIt's just another chapter of the drama that goes with the chip industry,\"" Moorhead says. He adds, \""Nvidia will lose market share on a percentage basis. They're going to lose market share to AMD (AMD). They're going to lose market share likely in [2026] to Intel. And then to designs made by Broadcom (AVGO) and Marvell (MRVL) that go into the hyperscalers. But the market is growing so quickly that it won't have much of an impact on Nvidia and its stock price.\"" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination here.

There is bipartisan support for industrial policy, especially for chips, but it comes down to results,\"" Goujon tells Yahoo Finance, noting that the \""stakes are high\"" for Intel (INTC) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) specifically. \""One important thing to keep in mind is that we've actually seen some pragmatism out of the Biden administration in realizing that these chip fabs are not going to be built on this kind of timeline if they don't start accelerating things. And so there have already been compromises, for example, on environmental reviews, where fabs are not going to need National Environmental Policy Act reviews, and that's all meant to kind of accelerate this process. So, in terms of trying to shore up the CHIPS Act, I would see those kinds of provisions being targeted but not the overall strategic goal of getting funding behind bolstering chip manufacturing in the United States,\"" the strategist says. She adds that \""technology controls targeting China are going to be a major feature of either administration,\"" with Trump saying he'll instate hefty tariffs while Harris may be more of the same, maintaining the status quo of the Biden administration.

Moor Insights & Strategy founder, CEO, and chief analyst Patrick Moorhead and Tufts University professor of International History Christopher Miller join Seana Smith and Madison Mills on Catalysts to discuss their outlook for the chip sector under Trump 2.0. Moorhead expects Trump to be a \""net positive\"" for the chip sector: \""Trump doesn't want to be the president that tanked the tech stock market, and he certainly could do that if he puts any weight on the chip stocks that have been a tremendous part of the growth over the last four years.\"" \""With all of the advanced semiconductor manufacturing leaving the United States, or most of it, Trump's trying to get the best deal to bring it back in.

Miller \u2014 the author of Chip War: The Fight for World's Most Critical Technology \u2014 says Trump's chip policy is \""being defined right now by the president-elect and his incoming administration,\"" adding that tariffs will likely be a key component of his approach to the semiconductor sector, though there will likely be negotiations between his proposals and the actual policies. Amid uncertainty about Trump's actual policies and their impacts on chipmakers, Moorhead cautions investors saying they \""should be looking into every one of their investment plays and seeing if they have a supply chain resilience plan.
